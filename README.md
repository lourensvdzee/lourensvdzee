### Hi there 👋

🏅 I'm happy to share I have successfully finished the Full Stack Development Bootcamp at Spiced Academy!

Now that I know the coding basics, I'm working on my own product <a href="http://www.vmdb.me">VMDb.me</a> in the meantime. Besides that, I have a new product in the pipeline. Expecting to share more of that soon!

About me: Product Manager with 7 years of experience with a heart for projects that reduce our global footprint 🌱. Strong background in Online Marketing & Tech innovation, and diverse industry experience including Retail, Travel, Automotive, and Finance. I possess a friendly and positive 'can do' attitude, a strong commercial sense, and ability to identify and capitalize on opportunities in a proactive manner.
